# Finalize Login Screen Implementation

Complete the login screen to exactly match the previous version's design and integrate it perfectly with the current authentication system.

## 1. Add Missing UI Element
*   Add the "Data is encrypted and stored locally on this device." text below the form in `LoginView.tsx` to match the live app screenshot.

## 2. Verify Router Integration
*   Ensure `WebRouter` correctly shows the login screen for unauthenticated users and redirects to the dashboard upon successful login.
*   Ensure `AppKitRouter` also correctly handles the new login flow and redirects.

## 3. Clean Up
*   Remove any temporary debug code.
*   Final check for production readiness.
